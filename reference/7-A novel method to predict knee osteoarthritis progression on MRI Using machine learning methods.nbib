AB  - This paper explored the hidden biomedical information from knee magnetic resonance 
      (MR) images for osteoarthritis (OA) prediction. We have computed the cartilage 
      damage index (CDI) information from 36 informative locations on tibiofemoral 
      cartilage compartment from 3-D MR imaging and used principal component analysis 
      (PCA) analysis to process the feature set. Four machine learning methods (artificial 
      neural network (ANN), support vector machine, random forest, and na√Øve Bayes) were 
      employed to predict the progression of OA, which was measured by the change of 
      Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade, Joint Space Narrowing on Medial compartment (JSM) 
      grade, and Joint Space Narrowing on Lateral compartment (JSL) grade. To examine the 
      different effects of medial and lateral informative locations, we have divided the 
      36-D feature set into a 18-D medial feature set and a 18-D lateral feature set and 
      run the experiment on four classifiers separately. Experiment results showed that 
      the medial feature set generated better prediction performance than the lateral 
      feature set, while using the total 36-D feature set generated the best. PCA analysis 
      is helpful in feature space reduction and performance improvement. For KL grade 
      prediction, the best performance was achieved by ANN with AUC = 0.761 and F-measure 
      = 0.714. For JSM grade prediction, the best performance was achieved by random 
      forest with AUC = 0.785 and F-measure = 0.743, while for JSL grade prediction, the 
      best performance was achieved by ANN with AUC = 0.695 and F-measure = 0.796. As 
      experiment results showing that the informative locations on medial compartment 
      provide more distinguishing features than informative locations on the lateral 
      compartment, it could be considered to select more points from the medial 
      compartment while reducing the number of points from the lateral compartment to 
      improve clinical CDI design.
